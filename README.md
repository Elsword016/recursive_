Optimization code for some of the questions. The colab instance was crashing since it was taking too long finish the trials so I locally optimized the model and used the best params in the submission notebooks.

1. part2_optimization.py - script to optimize the MLP question for Part 2 of the assignment
2. part2_2_lstm_tuning.py - script to optimize the LSTM for Part 2-2 of the assignment
